Version 1.1: 4th public release.

- Solved NUMERICAL INSTABILITY ISSUE with the calculation of the reweighting
  factor for the RHMC algorithm, in the case of generic power of the D^dag.D
  operator. Some details can be found in doc/rhmc.pdf.

- Fixed ERROR in the normalization of the U(1) plaquette action Uact calculated
  at positive flow-time.

- Fixed BUG in molecular dynamics with the MDINT_DBG macro. This bug does not
  affect results obtained with simulations programs compiled without the
  MDINT_DBG macro.

- Fixed BUG in the updated of deflation subspaces along the molecular dynamics
  (only the first deflation subspace was correctly updated). This bug affects
  the efficiency of the DFL_SAP_GCR solver in simulations that use more than one
  deflation subspace. This bug does not affect the correctness of the
  simulations.

- Changed the way in which the deflation subspace parameters are written in the
  *.par files generated by various main programs. This change implies a mild
  BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY: v1.1 main programs cannot be used to continue runs
  generated with v1.0 main programs.

- Implemented the U(1) dressing factors for the calculation of 2-point functions
  of electrically charged operators in a gauge-invariant way.

- Rewritten ms6. The new ms6 allows to calculate charged PS-PS and PS-A two
  point functions. Multiple flavours can be defined, and all possible pair of
  flavours are used to build interpolating operators.

- Rewritten ms2. The new ms2 allows to define multiple flavours can be defined,
  and also a list of powers can be specified for the power method (in such a way
  that one can study the convergence of the algorithm). 

- Fixed various minor isses in check programs.

- Fixed BUG in the devel/nompi/main/read.ms5 program: electromagnetic fluxes
  were not read in the correct order.

30. April 2019

Version 1.0: 3rd public release.

- Integrated the MinMax program for the calculation of the relevant rational
  approximations.

- Updated documentation.

- Added simple utilities in main/utils to compare solvers, and to merge SU(3)
  and U(1) configurations into SU(3)xU(1) configurations.

- Added the read.ms6 program in devel/nompi/main to read and analyze the dat
  file produced by ms6.

- In ms6, added the possibility to set the stochastic sources on randomly
  chosen timeslices in case of periodic boundary conditions.

- Implemented multiple deflation subspaces with independent parameters of the
  Dirac operator.

- Implemented Fourier acceleration for the U(1) gauge field. Described in detail
  in docs/fourier.pdf.

- Added the flag -unit to the command line of the main programs iso1, mxw1,
  qcd1, ym1, to start simulations for the unit configuration.

- Implemented generic boundary values for the U(1) gauge field at the SF
  boundaries.

- Restructured the parameter database. In particular the boundary conditions,
  gauge action, quark parameters have been reorganized. This is reflected in a
  substantial change of the input files. Several pieces of code have been moved
  from the main programs to newly created utility functions in the module flags.

- Implemented the reweighting factors for the RHMC. Generic powers of the
  D^dag D operator are supporter, and also twisted mass reweighting for the
  rational approximations. The reweighing factors are described in detail in
  doc/rhmc.pdf.

22. June 2017: 2nd public release (alpha).

- Corrected an error in the normalization of the gradient flow for the U(1)
  gauge field.

1. June 2017

Version 0.9a1: Initial public release (alpha). This code is heavily based on
openQCD-1.6. The salient differences with the openQCD-1.6 follow. More details
can be found in the files in the doc directory.

- SU(3) and SU(3)xU(1) gauge theories with or without fermions can be simulated,
  and also the pure U(1) theory. In particular the compact U(1) gague action is
  implemented, of the Lüscher-Weisz type with generic relative weight between
  single and double plaquette terms. Support for non-compact actions is
  available, but non-compact actions are not implemented at the moment.

- The O(a)-improved Dirac operator includes the coupling to the U(1) field in
  the hopping terms, and the Sheikholeslami–Wohlert term proportional to the
  U(1) field strength.

- In simulations with dynamical quarks, all parameters of the Dirac operator can
  be chosen independently for each flavour. These parameters are: mass, electric
  charge, theta angles defining phase-periodic boundary conditions, SU(3) and
  U(1) csw coefficients, boundary improvement coefficients.

- C* (or C-parity) boundary conditions can be chose in 1, 2 or 3 spatial
  directions. C* boundary conditions are implemented via an orbifold
  construction.

- The RHMC algorithm for generic powers of D^dag.D is supported. The needed
  rational approximations are generated by the utility progam MinMax, which is
  not included in the repository yet. Twisted-mass reweighting for the RHMC
  action is supported as well. The corresponding reweighting factors are
  implemented.

- The U(1) Wilson flow has been implemented, together with a number of basic
  observables: plaquette and clover U(1) actions, electromagnetic fluxes.
