Version 1.0: 3rd public release.

- Integrated the MinMax program for the calculation of the relevant rational
  approximations.

- Updated documentation.

- Added simple utilities in main/utils to compare solvers, and to merge SU(3)
  and U(1) configurations into SU(3)xU(1) configurations.

- Added the read.ms6 program in devel/nompi/main to read and analyze the dat
  file produced by ms6.

- In ms6, added the possibility to set the stochastic sources on randomly
  chosen timeslices in case of periodic boundary conditions.

- Implemented multiple deflation subspaces with independent parameters of the
  Dirac operator.

- Implemented Fourier acceleration for the U(1) gauge field. Described in detail
  in docs/fourier.pdf.

- Added the flag -unit to the command line of the main programs iso1, mxw1,
  qcd1, ym1, to start simulations for the unit configuration.

- Implemented generic boundary values for the U(1) gauge field at the SF
  boundaries.

- Restructured the parameter database. In particular the boundary conditions,
  gauge action, quark parameters have been reorganized. This is reflected in a
  substantial change of the input files. Several pieces of code have been moved
  from the main programs to newly created utility functions in the module flags.

- Implemented the reweighting factors for the RHMC. Generic powers of the
  D^dag D operator are supporter, and also twisted mass reweighting for the
  rational approximations. The reweighing factors are described in detail in
  doc/rhmc.pdf.


22. June 2017: 2nd public release (alpha).

- Corrected an error in the normalization of the gradient flow for the U(1)
  gauge field.
