List of functions
-----------------

void copy_bnd_u1ft(int n,double *ft)
  Fetches the boundary values the field ft from the neighbouring MPI
  processes (see the notes). The boundary values at time NPROC0*L0
  are fetched from the field at time 0 only in the case of periodic
  boundary conditions.

void add_bnd_u1ft(int n,double *ft)
  Adds the boundary values of the field ft to the field on the
  neighbouring MPI processes. The boundary values at time NPROC0*L0
  are added to the field at time 0 only in the case of periodic
  boundary conditions.

double **u1ftensor(void)
  Computes the symmetric field tensor of the global double-precision
  U(1) gauge field and returns the pointers ft[0],..,ft[5] to the field
  components with the Lorentz indices (0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(2,3),(3,1),
  (1,2). The arrays are automatically allocated if needed. Along the
  boundaries of the lattice (if any), the program sets the field to
  zero.

double u1fluxes(int munu)
  Calculates the "field-theoretic" electromagnetic fluxes of the global
  double-precision U(1) gauge field, using a symmetric expression for the
  gauge-field tensor. The function returns Phi_{mu nu} where the values of
  mu and nu corresponding to munu= 0,1,2,3,4,5 are (mu nu)= {0 1}, {0 2},
  {0 3}, {2 3}, {3 1}, {1 2}.

double u1fluxes_slices(int munu,double *Phisl)
  Calculates the "field-theoretic" electromagnetic fluxes Phi_{mu nu}(x0) of
  the global double-precision U(1) gauge field, using a symmetric expression
  for the gauge-field tensor. The variables Phisl[x0] for
  x0=0,...,NPROC0*L0-1 store the fluxes Phi_{mu nu}(x0) where the values of
  mu and nu corresponding to munu= 0,1,2,3,4,5 are (mu nu)= {0 1}, {0 2},
  {0 3}, {2 3}, {3 1}, {1 2}. In the case of open b.c. Phisl[NPROC0*L0-1]=0.
  The function returns Phi_{mu nu}.

double mxw_action(void)
  Returns the Maxwell action S (w/o prefactor 1/e^2) of the double-precision 
  gauge field, using a symmetric expression for the gauge-field tensor.

double mxw_action_slices(double *asl)
  Computes the sum asl[t] of the Maxwell action density (w/o prefactor 1/e^2) 
  of the double-precision gauge field at time t=0,1,...,N0-1 
  (where N0=NPROC0*L0). The program returns the total action.
