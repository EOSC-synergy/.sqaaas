List of functions
-----------------

void copy_bnd_su3frc(void)
  Copies the SU(3) force variables from the neighbouring MPI processes 
  to the exterior boundaries of the local lattice. The field variables
  on the spatial links at time NPROC0*L0 are fetched only in the case
  of periodic boundary conditions.

void add_bnd_su3frc(void)
  Adds the SU(3) force variables on the exterior boundaries of the local 
  lattice to the field variables on the neighbouring MPI processes.
  The field variables on the spatial links at time NPROC0*L0 are
  added only in the case of periodic boundary conditions.

void copy_bnd_u1frc(void)
  Copies the U(1) force variables from the neighbouring MPI processes 
  to the exterior boundaries of the local lattice. The field variables
  on the spatial links at time NPROC0*L0 are fetched only in the case
  of periodic boundary conditions.

void add_bnd_u1frc(void)
  Adds the U(1) force variables on the exterior boundaries of the local 
  lattice to the field variables on the neighbouring MPI processes.
  The field variables on the spatial links at time NPROC0*L0 are
  added only in the case of periodic boundary conditions.

mdflds_t *mdflds(void)
  Returns the pointer to a mdflds_t structure containing the force and
  momentum field. The fields are automatically allocated if needed.

void set_su3frc2zero(void)
  Sets all SU(3) force variables, including those on the boundary,
  to zero.

void bnd_su3mom2zero(void)
  Sets the components of the SU(3) momentum field on the static links
  to zero (see the notes).

void random_su3mom(void)
  Sets the elements X of the SU(3) momentum field on the active links
  to random values with distribution proportional to exp(tr{X^2}). On
  the static links the field is set to zero (see the notes).

double su3momentum_action(int icom)
  Returns the action of the SU(3) momentum field. The action is summed
  over all MPI processes if (and only if) icom=1.

void set_u1frc2zero(void)
  Sets all U(1) force variables, including those on the boundary,
  to zero.

void bnd_u1mom2zero(void)
  Sets the components of the U(1) momentum field on the static links
  to zero (see the notes).

void random_u1mom(void)
  Sets the elements X of the U(1) momentum field on the active links
  to random values with distribution proportional to exp(1/2 X^2). On
  the static links the field is set to zero (see the notes).

double u1momentum_action(int icom)
  Returns the action of the U(1) momentum field. The action is summed
  over all MPI processes if (and only if) icom=1.

void orbi_cpy_su3mom(void)
  The SU(3) momentum field on each secondary process is set to be
  equal to the cstar-transform of the field on the mirror process.

void orbi_add_su3frc(void)
  The SU(3) force field on each process is added to the cstar-transform of
  the force field on the mirror process.

void orbi_cpy_u1mom(void)
  The U(1) momentum field on each secondary process is set to be
  equal to the cstar-transform of the field on the mirror process.

void orbi_add_u1frc(void)
  The U(1) force field on each process is added to the cstar-transform of
  the force field on the mirror process.
