Saving/restoring field configurations to/from files.

check1        Writing and reading of gauge configurations.

check2        Exporting and importing gauge configurations.

check3        Importing a previously exported configuration.

check4        Writing and reading spinor fields.

check5        Exporting and importing spinor fields.

check6        Importing a previously exported spinor field.

The programs check1,check2,check3 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the
type of boundary condition to be chosen (open boundary conditions are assumed
if the option is not set). All other programs are insensitive to the boundary
conditions.

The programs check[1-3] accept the option -gg <gauge> that allows the gauge
group (0=QCD, 1=QED, 2=QCD+QED) to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not
set, QCD is assumed.

The programs check[1-3] accept the option -cs <cstar> that allows the number
of spatial directions with C* boundary conditions to be chosen at runtime. When
the option is not set, periodic boundary conditions in space are assumed.
