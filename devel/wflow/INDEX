Integration of the Wilson flow

check1        Basic checks on the implementation of the Wilson flow.

check2        Gauge covariance of the Wilson flow.

check3        Convergence of the numerical integration.

check4        Consistency between U(1) and SU(3) Wilson flows.

The programs check1, check2 and check4 accept the option -bc <type> that allows
the type of boundary condition to be chosen (open boundary conditions are
assumed if the option is not set). In the case of check3, the boundary 
conditions are set through the input parameter file.
