Allocation and calculation of the U(3) gauge field.

check1        Initialization, unitarity, determinant relation, group property
              of the U(3) fields, i.e. hdfld() and hfld().

time1         Timing of hdfld() and ud1fld(LOC).

The programs check1 and time1 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the type
of boundary condition to be chosen. When the option is not set, open boundary
conditions are assumed.

The programs check1 and time1 accept the option -gg <gauge> that allows the
gauge group (0=QCD, 1=QED, 2=QCD+QED) to be chosen at runtime. When the option
is not set, QCD is assumed.

The program check1 accepts the option -q <echarge> that allows the electric
charge to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not set, q=-3 is assumed.

The program time1 accepts the option -cs <cstar> that allows the number
of spatial directions with C* boundary conditions to be chosen at runtime. When
the option is not set, periodic boundary conditions in space are assumed.
