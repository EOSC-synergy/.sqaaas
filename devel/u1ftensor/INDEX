Computation of the U(1) symmetric field tensor and the Maxwell action.

check1         Check of the gauge and translation invariance of the Maxwell action.

check2         Maxwell action of background fields with constant field tensor.

check3         Check of the program mxw_action_slices().

check4         Check of the gauge and translation invariance of the U(1) fluxes.

check5         U(1) fluxes of background fields with constant field tensor.

check6         Check of the program u1fluxes_slices().

check7         Consistency checks between U(1) and SU(3) field tensors

All programs accept the option -bc <type> that allows the type of boundary
condition to be chosen. When the option is not set, open boundary conditions
are assumed.

The program check6 accepts the option -cs <cstar> that allows the number of
spatial directions with C* boundary conditions to be chosen at runtime. When the
option is not set, no C* boundary conditions are assumed.
