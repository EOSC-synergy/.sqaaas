Little Dirac operator

check1        Check of the programs in the module Aw_gen.c.

check2        Check of the program  b2b_flds().

check3        Direct check of Aw_dble() and Aw().

check4        Consistency checks on Aw_dble(),..,Awhat().

check5        Check of the program set_ltl_modes().

time1         Timing of Awhat().

The programs check3,..,time1 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the type
of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not set, open
boundary conditions are assumed. The option may be set but has no effect in the
case of check1.

The programs check2,..,time1 accept the option -gg <gauge> that allows the
gauge group (1=QCD, 2=QED, 3=QCD+QED) to be chosen at runtime. When the option
is not set, QCD is assumed.

The program time1 accepts the option -cs <cstar> that allows the number
of spatial directions with C* boundary conditions to be chosen at runtime. When
the option is not set, periodic boundary conditions in space are assumed.
