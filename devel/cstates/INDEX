Computation of the U(1) gauge factor for electrically charged states.

check1         Check of the cfactor for a particular choice of the U(1) field.

check2         Gauge covariance of mul_cfactor().

check2b        Gauge covariance with orbifold constraint of mul_cfactor().

check3         nabla_k A_k=0 for the Coulomb U(1) gauge field A^C_mu.

check4         Action of nabla_sq_dvec(), div_sym_dvec() and inv_nabla_sq_dvec() 
               on plane waves.

check5         Check of the inversion program inv_nabla_sq().

check6         Gauge invariance of the CA_mu(y0,x0) and CP(y0,x0) correlators.

All programs (except check6 that has an input file) accept the option -bc <type> 
that allows the type of boundary condition to be chosen. When the option is not
set, open boundary conditions are assumed.

The programs check1, check1b, check2, check2b and check3 must be run with the 
option -cs < cstar >=1 > in order to chose the number of spatial directions with
C*  boundary conditions.
