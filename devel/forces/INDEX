Except for check5 and check8, all programs accept the option -bc <type> that
allows the type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option
is not set, open boundary conditions are assumed. The option may be set but has
no effect in the case of check5 and check8 (the boundary conditions are selected
through the input parameter file in these cases).

The programs check1,2,3,12,13,14 accept the option -sf <SF_type> that
allows the type of gauge SF-boundary action to be chosen at runtime. When the
option is not set, the orbifold convention is assumed.

The program time1 accepts the option -cs <cstar> that allows the number
of spatial directions with C* boundary conditions to be chosen at runtime. When
the option is not set, periodic boundary conditions in space are assumed.
