Basic checks for MD auxiliary fields.

check1        Check boundary conditions of random SU(3) momentum.

check2        Check boundary conditions of random U(1) momentum.

check3        Check of the programs gather_u1mom() and scatter_u1mom().

check4        Check of the program u1mom_Delta_no0 with plane waves.

check5        Check of the program u1mom_Delta_no0.

All programs accept the option -bc <type> that allows the type of boundary
condition to be chosen. When the option is not set, open boundary conditions
are assumed.

All programs accept the option -cs <cstar> that allows the number of spatial
directions with C* boundary conditions to be chosen at runtime. When the option
is not set, no C* boundary conditions are assumed.
