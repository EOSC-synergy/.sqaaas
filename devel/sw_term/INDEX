Calculation of the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert term

check1        Allocation, assignment and inversion of the global SW arrays.

check2        Check of the gauge covariance of the SW term.

check3        Check of the SW term for abelian background fields.

time1         Timing of the program sw_term().

All programs accept the option -bc <type> that allows the type of boundary
condition to be chosen. When the option is not set, open boundary conditions
are assumed. 

All programs accept the option -gg <gauge> that allows the gauge group (0=QCD,
1=QED, 2=QCD+QED) to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not set, QCD is
assumed.

The program time1 accepts the option -cs <cstar> that allows the number of
spatial directions with C* boundary conditions to be chosen at runtime. When the
option is not set, periodic boundary conditions in space are assumed.
