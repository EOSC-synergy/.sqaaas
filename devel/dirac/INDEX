Programs for the O(a)-improved Wilson-Dirac operator.

check1        Gauge covariance of Dw().

check2        Action of Dw() on plane waves.

check3        Hermiticity of Dw() and comparison with
              Dwee(),..,Dwhat().

check4        Gauge covariance of Dw_dble().

check5        Action of Dw_dble() on plane waves.

check6        Hermiticity of Dw_dble() and comparison with
              Dwee_dble(),..,Dwhat_dble().

check7        Comparison of Dw_blk() with Dw().

check8        Comparison of Dw_blk_dble() with Dw_dble().

check9        Comparison of Dw_bnd() with Dw().

time1         Timing of Dw() and Dwhat().

time2         Timing of Dw_dble() and Dwhat_dble().

time3         Timing of Dw_blk() and Dwhat_blk().

time4         Timing of Dw_blk_dble() and Dwhat_blk_dble().

The programs check1,..,time4 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the
type of time boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not
set, open boundary conditions in time are assumed.

The programs check1,..,time4 accept the option -gg <gauge> that allows the
gauge group (1=QCD, 2=QED, 3=QCD+QED) to be chosen at runtime. When the option
is not set, QCD is assumed.

The programs check1,..,check9 accept the option -q <echarge> that allows to set
the (integer) electric charge of the Dirac operator. This option has effect only
if the QED field is active. When the option is not set, q=-3 is assumed.

The programs check1,..,time4 accept the option -cs <cstar> that allows the
number of spatial directions with C* boundary conditions to be chosen at
runtime. When the option is not set, periodic boundary conditions in space are
assumed.
