Schwarz Alternating Procedure (SAP) and SAP_GCR solver

check1        Check of the block solver programs.

check2        Direct test of the Schwarz alternating procedure.

check3        Check and performance of the SAP+GCR solver.

time1         Timing of blk_mres() and blk_eo_mres().

time2         Timing of the SAP preconditioner.

The programs check1, check2, time1 and time2 accept the option -bc <type> that
allows the type of time boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the
option is not set, open boundary conditions in time are assumed.

The programs time1 and time2 accept the option -gg <gauge> that allows the
gauge group (0=QCD, 1=QED, 2=QCD+QED) to be chosen at runtime. When the option
is not set, QCD is assumed.

The programs time1 and time2 accept the option -cs <cstar> that allows the number
of spatial directions with C* boundary conditions to be chosen at runtime. When
the option is not set, periodic boundary conditions in space are assumed.
