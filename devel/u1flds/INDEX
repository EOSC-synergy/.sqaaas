Allocation and initialization of the global U(1) gauge fields.

check1        Initialization of the U(1) fields.

check2        Calculation of the comm buffers of the compact U(1) field.

check3        Consistency between U(1) and SU(3) shifts.

check4        Consistency between U(1) and SU(3) plaquette sums.

check5        Consistency between U(1) and SU(3) boundary staple field.

check6        Check of the programs for the plaquette sums of the
              double-precision U(1) gauge field.

check7        Check of the program set_u1_bstap().

check8        Renurmalization the noncompact U(1) field.

All programs accept the option -bc <type> that allows the type of boundary
condition to be chosen. When the option is not set, open boundary conditions
are assumed.

All programs accept the option -cs <cstar> that allows the number of spatial
directions with C* boundary conditions to be chosen at runtime. When the option
is not set, no C* boundary conditions are assumed.
