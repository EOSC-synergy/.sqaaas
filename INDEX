At the top level, the openQ*D package is structured as follows: 

devel            Directories used for developing and testing the various 
                 modules

doc              Documentation files. These will be available in future
                 releases. For the time being, we suggest to look at the 
                 documentation files of the openQCD package in the dir
                 doc/openQCD-1.6

include          All include files. Typically there is one include file
                 per directory in the modules directory

main             Collection of main programs

modules          Source code of all modules 

Short descriptions of the program functionalities are included in the source
directories and at the top of each program file. Further information is found
in various README files (such as main/README.global).
